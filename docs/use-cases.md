# Use cases

Only the owner accepts a use case, classifies it (must, later, out) or changes an accepted one.

Each use case traces to at least one ADR and, once code exists, to at least one test. New use cases follow the
[template](#template) at the end of this file.

| Id | Use case | Class | ADRs | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Template

To add a use case:

1. Take the next free id and add a row to the table above: the class empty (or proposed, when an agent drafts it),
   the ADRs and tests empty until they exist, the status `draft`.
2. Copy the block below to the end of the list of use cases, before this section, and replace every `<placeholder>`.

```markdown
## UC-N. <what the actor can do, as a short sentence>

**Actor:** <who acts: a person's role or an agent>. **Goal:** <what they want, in their terms>.

1. <a step: who does what, as seen from outside>
2. <a step>

**Done when:** <a condition that can be checked, so a test can trace to it>.
```

Rules:

- **One goal per use case.** If the steps serve two goals, write two use cases.
- **What, not how.** Steps say what the actor and orus do, as seen from outside; formats and designs belong in ADRs.
- **Checkable.** "Done when" must be something a test or a run can show, never "works well".
- **The owner decides.** An agent may write a use case only as `draft` and may only propose its class. Only the owner
  sets the class (must, later, out) and the status `accepted`, and an accepted use case changes only by the owner.
